<h1>Baler</h1>

Baler is a very small PHP and JavaScript application I wrote over the course of a weekend. It allows farming contractors to keep track of bales made for a client and quickly get an idea of how much it'll cost the client.

Please note that the programming isn't the best as I was focused on getting it done in time for a friend.
